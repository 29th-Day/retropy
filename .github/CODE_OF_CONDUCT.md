# Code of Conduct

## Community Guidelines

Be welcoming. Approach everything with good intent.

## Piracy & ROM Sharing

Emulation should solely involve the use of legally acquired ROM files. RetroPy does not support, condone, or associate with any acts of piracy or ROM sharing. Engaging in such activities will result in strict enforcement of a zero-tolerance policy.

*The handeling of ROM files by their respective copyright holder may be questionable, but this not the place to discuss this.*
