# RetroPy: A python(ic) frontend for libretro

> "Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores also in their own programs or devices."

## About

RetroPy is a libretro frontend (NOT CORE) written in Python. It is meant to be a bridge between fast, accuarte, well implemented, and tested emulators and Python.

RetroPy uses provided Shared Libraries (`.dll` / `.so`) and a pythonic wrapper, making heavy use of `ctypes`, to enable the user to interact with a large variety of emulators and therefore videogames.
