# RetroPy: A python(ic) frontend for libretro

> "Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores also in their own programs or devices."

## About

RetroPy is a libretro frontend (NOT CORE) written in Python. It is meant bridge the gap between fast, accurate, well-implemented, and tested emulators and Python.

RetroPy utilizes supplied Shared Libraries (`.dll` / `.so`) and a pythonic wrapper, leveraging `ctypes` extensively. This approach enables users to seamlessly interact with a diverse range of emulators and, consequently, video games.

## Install

Additionally, cores from alternative sources can be discovered on the internet within their respective communities.
