# Frontends

## Gymnasium

Frontend implementing `gymnasium`'s API (formerly `gym`).

Particularly useful for AI applications, especially in reinforcement learning. Additional details can be found in the [documentation](https://gymnasium.farama.org/ "Gymnasium Documentation").

## Interactive

If your primary goal is to play retro games, I strongly recommend using player-focused frontends like [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/). Interactive frontends within retropy are implemented to showcase its capabilities and for debugging purposes.

### Pygame

Frontend using pygame. No audio support due to the way pygame handles audio.

### Pyglet

Frontend using pygame. Maybe audio support?
