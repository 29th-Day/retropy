## Welcome to the RetroPy documentation

RetroPy is a libretro frontend (NOT CORE) written in Python. It is meant bridge the gap between fast, accurate, well-implemented, and tested emulators and Python.

### Why RetroPy?

The idea behind RetroPy is to enable easy **integration of video games into machine learning** pipelines. Especially for reinforcement learning, having access to thousands of environments with wide ranging complexity and high level of control is incredibly valuable. Video games have historically served as valuable tools for validating and visualizing machine learning algorithms and their decision-making processes. Additionally, they act as an engaging and motivating bridge to attract new talent and interest to the field of AI.

### Why libretro?

> "Libretro is a simple but powerful development interface that allows for the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug straight into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores also in their own programs or devices."

TL;DR: Libretro is a common API to interact with emulators.
